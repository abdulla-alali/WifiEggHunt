This software is meant to detect preconfigured static Access Points' MAC
Address when coming in close proximity to them.

It is programmed as a community service to help students understand how Wireless
Access points work by finding these Access Points by walking around the Northeastern
University campus. When students find these access points, a message popups and let's
them know that they have found an Egg or the Wifi Access Point.
